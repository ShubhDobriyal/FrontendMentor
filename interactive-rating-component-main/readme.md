#Hi 
##The design for this component is picked from a Frontend mentor challenge named Interactive rating component
##Challenge was simple to create a rating system where user can select a rating value and submit it to show the thankyou page
##Changes that I have done:
 - utilised the localstorage to hold the rating value
 - the html for thankyou card is generated using js instead of a static code
